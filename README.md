Introduction:

Finding out which airports have the most delayed arrivals and departures is crucial for evaluating air travel delays. Gaining knowledge about these airports' typical delay times might help you understand their overall effectiveness. The major airports, like Los Angeles International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, frequently see larger passenger volumes, which could be a factor in these delays. Furthermore, knowing which airline experiences the greatest delays might assist travelers in making well-informed choices. Holidays and the summer are peak travel seasons, which can worsen delays and affect the performance of airlines as a whole. Age can also affect how well an airplane performs, which can affect safety and delay times. Regularly used routes might be more congested, which would add to the delays. Flight delays are often caused by weather, particularly in the winter or during extreme weather. Weather conditions play a significant role in delaying flights, especially during winter or severe weather events. Holiday seasons, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, often strain airline schedules, increasing the likelihood of delays. Lastly, understanding which airline is most used by passengers can shed light on industry trends and service efficiency.
